# MATH4338
LaTeX files associated with proofs written for MATH 4338 Real Analysis

### Method
I am using TextMate and the associated LaTeX bundle to write the `.tex` files and quickly render the PDFs.

To create the `.pdf` from the `.tex`, via the command line
1. Make sure the system you are running on has LaTeX installed.
2. run `latex foo.tex` to create the `.dvi` file from the `.tex` file.
3. run `dvipdf foo.dvi`
